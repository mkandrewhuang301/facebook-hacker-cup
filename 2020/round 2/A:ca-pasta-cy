No code: just solution
get original points and find all new points
then with new points, solve for total. If total is less than sum of x or over the the sum of x + sum of y, then it is impossible

if it is possible (meaning some order can allow all to be not ower and not upper), find amoutn voer and amount below
answer is just max(upper,lower)
as it only takes maximum one move to relocate a person
